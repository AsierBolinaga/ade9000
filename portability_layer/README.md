# portability layel

The aim of this project is to create a layer to be used in different projects, so the logic of the application of the projects using it will need no changes if the platform of the project changes to another. 

Each project using this layer, needs to have a pl_config.h file to define the different labels to activate the different modules controlling the peripherals or the reosurces of the SO or microcontroller.
